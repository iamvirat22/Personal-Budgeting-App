# Personal_Budgeting_Application
Budgeting is creating a plan to spend your money. Good budgeting is spending less than
you are earning as you plan for your financial goals. Budgeting is the fundamental step
in achieving financial literacy, and by extension, reaching financial security and freedom.
Budgeting is the process of creating a plan to spend and invest your hard earned money
wisely to meet your personal and financial goals in life. It should not be a mathematical
exercise that we think we have to endure; rather, it is the result of self-assessment of our
relationship with money and a necessary road map to steer us toward a higher standard
and quality of living.
